# Diesease-diagnosis-Application-using-Machine-learning
An Android Application which leverages the power of machine learning models for prediction of disease based on user input symtoms
To Implement this
1:Run the python file disease diagnosis on google colab or which ever python ide you select
2:The Disease Dataset is also provided which has list of symtoms with diseases it has been download from kaagle website
